# Hostile {-}

![](imgs/hostile.png)

**Hostile** is a tabletop RPG set in a universe that combines elements of gritty science fiction, horror, and political intrigue. It is heavily inspired by the aesthetics and themes of classic 1970s and 1980s sci-fi movies such as "Alien," "Blade Runner," and "Outland." The game is designed to evoke a sense of being on the edge of known space, where human life is cheap, corporate interests dominate, and the unknown looms at every corner.

Space is a hostile environment, not just because of its physical dangers but also due to the socio-political landscape. The game emphasises themes of corporate greed, the expendability of human life in the pursuit of profit, and the struggle of the working class against oppressive systems. Political intrigue plays a significant role, with factions within and between corporations, as well as other groups with their agendas, vying for power and influence.

#### Themes {-}

- **Gritty sci-fi**: Characters are blue collar spacers, working dangerous jobs in the hostility of space. Every hazard is trying to kill characters all the time. Everything in the world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained. Earth is a traditional cyberpunk setting, but in space there is much less "street violence", and cybernetics are generally not reliable. *List of hazards: lack of oxygen, vacuum, radiation, excessive cold, excessive heat, aliens, alien infections, poisonous atmosphere, high pressure atmosphere, high decompression rate and high gravity acceleration in large bodies.*
- **Horror & fear**: A cynical world, filled with everyday people going about their jobs is a common starting point for good horror stories. Humans are not alone in the universe. Alien predators have been found in multiple worlds, and sometimes even in asteroids. Advanced alien societies had their remnants found by earth explorers, but intelligent life is still to be observed. Some theorists say they have been found, and are among us. And none knows when and where aliens will be found.
- **Political intrigue & treachery**: Several factions with their own motives and goals. Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties. Factions are classified in 3 groups:
	- **Technology & resourceful factions**: the strongest group, mostly formed by Mega Corporations and their subsidiaries.
	- **Belief factions**: their Influence is subtle and ideological, mostly formed by religions and conspiracy theorists
	- **Rising authoritative supra-government**: early years of an attempt of Earth governments to regain control from the Mega Corporations hands - the Terran Mandate.

*More detail on the Hostile book, pages 9-10.*

#### Aesthetic {-}

The aesthetic of **Hostile** is defined by its gritty, realistic approach to science fiction. Technology is not clean and advanced but rather functional, often run-down, and always with a practical purpose. Cybernetics are unreliable, and life in space is hazardous, with threats such as lack of oxygen, radiation, and alien infections being commonplace. The setting is designed to feel lived-in, with every location showing signs of wear and decay, reflecting the hard life of those who dwell in space.
