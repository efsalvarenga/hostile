Stars Without Numbers (SWN) is an OSR system, which allows me to easily reskin a lot published materials since the 80s. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). For SWN I can easily convert any D&D adventure (any version, easier with up to 2e), and Call of Cthulhu (d100 systems) with some small work.

## Character creation guidance

- Character creation on the SWN book, pages 3 to 25. Pre-built characters are available on page 26.
- Classes available: warrior, expert or mix/adventurer (i.e. no magic or psionic powers)
- Character sheet: [fillable pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bM8pMgGjMKao6s-12BjnkQ9MzXhFJ8i2/view?usp=drivesdk), [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vw6EHrl_2-8BcHob2_bxvcpLnVbAHbW3StjrNEFoKg/edit#gid=1671565117) or [freebooter app](https://www.swnfreebooter.net/)
- Replacements will join the crew at level 1.

## House rules

- Every time PCs level up they can negotiate a promotion in their profession with their current contract.
- (tbd) 3+ players we go ahead with the game. Or 4+?
- (tbd around level 5) Domain play (i.e.: player driven faction to build a colony, once characters are higher level, and if players are interested in it)
- NB.: Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed): Any rule, class, foci, etc from any OSR game can be considered. [Sine Nomine](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing) books are very easy to integrate with each other. I have a few of them if someone is interested.

*Exposure to the occult leaves mundane creatures vulnerable to stimuli, sense perceptions, and revelations that their minds were never meant to perceive. The knowledge is like an infection. It burrows, it burns, and it consumes. Recognising the strange angles of a damnable creature’s wings reveals to the hero a whole new panorama of inhuman shapes and horrific vistas, such that she might suffer uncontrollable fits of panic when confronted with some mundane object that just happens to echo those hideous arcs. A human mind is forced open and compelled to receive impressions that more blessedly ignorant souls need never confront. The best that most sufferers can do is to create a firebreak around the idea, a zone of scorched reason to serve as a buffer against the awareness. This takes the shape of a Delirium, a focused insanity that allows them to rationalise or reject an insight. This lessens the grip of Madness and gives them some respite from its pains.*

**Sanity score**

The full sanity score is set as the **maximum between Intelligence and Wisdom, multiplied by 5 - respecting a minimum of 50 and maximum of 90**. The current sanity score, at all times, will fluctuate being equal or less the full sanity score. **If the current score ever reaches 0 the character is hopelessly lost** in their own tormented perceptions and can no longer function as a player character.

**Sanity checks, and loosing sanity**

**Once per scene, the GM might require PCs to make a sanity check. That is done with a d100 roll under the current sanity score. On a failure the PC looses sanity score as per table below.** The sanity check might be triggered by bloodshed, deep eldritch and alien events. A mind has a limit to the amount of insanity it can incur in a single event. After a certain point the senses numb and no further horror can be experienced. In a single scene, a character can lose no more sanity score than the (non cumulative) maximum result of the worst shock they confront.

| Event type | Cost | Examples                                                                                                                   |

| Bloodshed  | 2d10 | Witnessing the death of a party member in a gruesome or horrific manner                                                    |

**Deliria, and recovering sanity**

*While the Delirium can be burdensome, it shelters them from the worst of their suffering. Too many Deliria can prove ruinous, however, as each additional Delirium increases the risk of a cascade of failing defences and exposure to unendurable realisations. The higher the edifice of madness is built, the more likely it is to fall.*

**Players might choose to accept a Delirium** for their characters to recover sanity score. After gaining a new Delirium, the PC must advance a level before accruing any more; the mind’s flexibility is limited. The player can choose what delirium they get (see material below) or roll randomly in a chosen table. It is easier to choose the new Delirium in-between sessions, and discuss the roleplay and mechanical results with the GM.

**Deliria examples (non comprehensive)**
- 5e's long term of indefinite madness [tables](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/madness)
- 3.5e SRD variant indefinite insanity [table 6-11](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/sanity.htm)
- Ravenloft's [dark gifts](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,1,dark%20gift%20descriptions,0)
- Call of Cthulhu's [phobias and manias](https://cthulhuwiki.chaosium.com/rules/sanity.html#sample-phobias-and-manias)
- Silent Legions' [sample deliria](https://i.imgur.com/pHGjaC1.png)

After taking the Delirum the player **rolls 1d20; if the roll is equal or greater than their total number of Deliria then the newfound structure and rationalisation soothes their mind**, recovering 10 points of sanity. If the roll is less than their total number of Deliria, then the fresh insanity just makes everything worse, and 10 points of sanity are lost. Once accrued, Deliria can never be lost.

Some Deliria come with phobias and compulsions. A PC can resist the phobia or compulsion by making a successful Sanity Check. On a failure, he or she must obey the Delirium unless they are willing to lose 1d6 sanity points for defying the structure they have fashioned to protect their sanity.

Alternatively, sanity can be recovered slowly, and under care of calming therapies. **PCs recover 1 sanity score per long rest, if they are able to rest in a complete calm environment, with friends or professionals to attend to them, and talk to them**. When PCs are accruing levels, **they also recover sanity score at the rate of 1 plus the best of the PC's INT and WIS modifiers**.

### Character advancement

Required XP will use a higher inclination curve (without impact in progress pace), akin traditional OSR. This allows new characters to progress rather quickly to catch up with veterans. XP awarded will be scaled to the dangers the PCs faced on each session.

### Equipment

- Equipment from the SWN book is considered the standard most common equipment available.
	- We are in year 2225, which means the maximum available technology is TL4 (SWN 63)
- More specific items, such as those from Hostile books, will cost their $ value in credits, sometimes being significantly more expensive than common equipment.
	- [Hostile Setting](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fJPqFVlO9pqcjg7lMVgE9lAy4_vml6pW&usp=drive_fs) for generic equipment
	- [Hostile Toolkits](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fL8DRXAaHosQ6aXeTCiIC1YKSVjhVCgk&usp=drive_fs) for specific equipment (includes explosives)
	- [Hostile Gun Locker](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fKPO19H1ZY4RAQoknhycMyO8sL4MN02V&usp=drive_fs) for weapons

## Mining

All below assumes a 24h (2 12h shift) operations. Each shift must make it roll once for the entire job.

- Locate suitable ice chunk: Int/programme DC 8, takes 1d6 days
- Scan the topology for mapping surface area and composition of the entire chunk: Int/Programme or Int/Know DC 8, takes 1d6 days
- Travel to the rock (150 - Int/Pilot check), then a new rock in the same chunk takes 1d6 x 5h. **Each rock has a 1-in-6 chance of having a sky tomb.**
- Each shift a crew member is appointed as mining supervisor. GM rolls Cha or Wis /Fix 2d6 and checks for a mining problem.
- Geology and sampling (1d6 + 3 are required in different rocks, at least two different chunks)
	- Drill with logging tool (EVA or drone): Dex if EVA, Int if drone, Programme or Pilot DC 8, takes 1d6h per drill.
	- Evaluate logs, Int/Know DC 7, takes 1d6h - roll asteroid yield once per chunk. If the rock has a sky tomb, the RNA is found in the ice.
	- Set explosives and net (EVA or drone): Dex/Programme or Dex/Pilot DC 10, takes 1d3 hours.
	- Extract (drones): Int/Programme or Int/Pilot DC 8, takes 1d6 hours
