<p>Advanced alien ruins were found in 2225 in the Perdurabo system. An ice sample was bought by Tharsis’ Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system.</p>
<p>If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process).</p>
<p>Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station’s steel skin.</p>

<p>On the evening before the mission kick-off meeting with Tharsis Mining Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod, the crew find a scientist from Haruna tied to a bomb in the toilets of a bar in French Guiana. They learn of the animosity of the Lebkuchen activists against Haruna’s cloning endeavours. After all that is sorted, they decide to bet on Olaf in a boxing ring, which proves to be successful.</p>
<p>On the next day they finally meet with John McLeod, and preparations for the travel to Perdurabo start.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs crew arrives in Brightside. Brightside is a space mining station owned by <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xla77J1.png">Haruna</a>, part of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VY7zssZ.png">Matsuyama</a> group.</li>
<li>The crew meets a few of the faces on the station and take a space raft to their own ship, which is stationary close by Brightside.</li>
<li>After a quick inspection, the Frostbreaker seems in order, and the crew get back to Brightside to sign paperwork.</li>
<li>While mingling a bit more with the inhabitants of the station, they end up befriending Marius, a scientific representative from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bVblDuU.png">Makita</a> (part of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QEu2vfo.png">Wu-Ketai</a> group). He is invited for a mission launch party onboard the Frostbreaker and, on the way there, the crew also invites Roland.</li>
<li>Everyone gets drunk and drugged and some information is learned: Marius thinks his job is demeaning while Roland has data that incriminates Yash (Brightside Director) of embezzlement.</li>
<li>In the following morning the crew have a virtual meeting with John McLeod, who is unhappy that some information might have leaked about the intention to drill ice in the asteroid. Olaf takes a decision to visit one of the sky tombs in the region, to pretend the crew is one of adventurers and dismiss questions.</li>
<li>The crew goes back and negotiate with Marius and Ranse, and they purchase the coordinates of one of the sky tombs that could possess some riches.</li>

<p><strong>MadSpark’s version of the story</strong>
&gt; <strong><em>MadSpark doesn’t remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows</em></strong>
&gt; - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt
&gt; - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife)
&gt; - found some great spare parts for the little drone I’ve been planning to make
&gt; - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone
&gt; - everyone wanted to explore the space station &amp; I needed a drink anyway so off we went
&gt; - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it’s not allowed here… 🤷🏼‍♂️) but the skipper sorted it out &amp; then we headed to the bar (it’s interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven’t seen those of years, I’ll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons)
&gt; - I bought drinks all night &amp; did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don’t remember much after that
&gt; - Oh yeah, we’re going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah 💰(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!)</p>

<div id="the-old-tomb" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The old tomb<a href="mrna-resources.html#the-old-tomb" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Doomborgs crew arrive in the Cold Tomb. The structure was built in an ice chunk in one of the asteroids in the Perdurabo system.</li>
<li>The ship is docked in the entrance of the tomb, and Olaf and Oliver suit up and are ready in the air lock. Through a scan they know that beyond the tomb entrance door the environment is filled with icy water.</li>
<li>The two crewmen venture inside, with a system of communication and power umbilicals and a 50 meter harness cable. Sabaka stays behind in the airlock ready to rewind the cable if necessary.</li>
<li>In the entrance room, shaped like a sphere, they record on their cameras alien language carved in the icy wall, and an image depicting a blurred humanoid alien in what seems like a position of power.</li>
<li>While this was happening, MadSpark feels the need of action, and leaves the ship in a second airlock. While investigating the surroundings of the construction, he detects faint biological matter readings on his suit. He communicates that to Olaf and Oliver, who now turn on their precise detectors too, receiving the same readings.</li>
<li>The crew hypothesise that the readings are coming from the water (melted from the asteroid ice), and take a sample from inside the tomb. MadSpark gets back on the ship and take the sample to the lab. He starts to feel dizzy.</li>
<li>In the tomb, Oliver and Olaf reach another room where they find dozens of alien bodies floating in the water. They quickly grab one and, in a haste movement, decide to retreat to the spaceship.</li>
<li>On their way back, a drone swims in their direction and shoots a shard of metal in their direction, but the crewmen were faster and lock themselves in the airlock before the drone can enter. Oni skillfully undock the Frostbreaker from the tomb and pilot the ship back to Brightside.</li>
<li>After decontaminating the air, Olaf and Oliver join the crew in the ship again, but now everyone is feeling slightly sick, unfocused and dizzy.</li>
<li>On the way back, some movement readings withing the starship structure alert Oni. The crew quickly retreat to the citadel and command the ship from there. They soon see in the cameras a dozens crab-like alien creatures exploring she starship.</li>
<li>MadSpark flushes the starship atmosphere. At the same time Olaf starts to feel very sick and anxious. He thinks for a brief moment that MadSpark is flushing the citadel and panics. The other crew members calm him down, and they all see the crab creatures passing out.</li>
<li>Upon arrival in Brightside, Yash Dutta does not allow the immediate off boarding of the crew due to contamination risk, and Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. John quickly decides that the finding is too high profile, and the Doomborgs are ordered to immediatelly travel back to Earth.</li>
<li>After a failed attempt to threat Yash, the Frostbreaker departs from Brightside. The destination is the Teegarden’s Star system, where in the main world (Defiance) a remote office of Tharsis and the ICO (Interstellar Commerce Organisation) are available.</li>

<li>The Doomborgs crew travel to the neighbour system: the Teegarden’s Star. During the spike drill, Bennet used the time to execute a biopsy on one of the crab creatures that infested the starship previously. The doctor was very unlucky when a splash of acid hits his eyes, blinding him.</li>
<li>Upon arriving on Teegarden’s Star, the captain makes contact with the system control and gets redirected to the Tharsis Mining office on the <a href="https://sectorswithoutnumber.com/sector/E9FKrPjS8tsRmoryYMpe/planet/UBzrpfVGWXxJZq6C9ndC">Defiance</a>. A shuttle picks the crew from orbit and a truck and a car takes them and the corpse to the corporation estate.</li>
<li>The Doomborgs meet Lucas, a rough operations coordinator in the system, who explains next steps: they are to complete the mining contract as fast as possible, avoiding any further information leak. The Boxer crew, a group of mercenaries, will be responsible for collecting the remaining corpses and taking them to Earth.</li>
<li>While the meeting goes on, Bennet is in the hospital, and learns his eyes are doomed. He will need a cybernetic implant, and that can be arranged within a week.</li>
<li>The crew meets again, and decide that waiting a week would be too long. Sabaka connects on the dark web and finds a fixer that can help them get a second hand cybereyes set within a day. The Doomborgs agree with the fixer and go to the appointed location, a district nightclub.</li>
<li>In the nightclub they meet an energetic girl, who are to guide them getting the second hand cybereyes - from someone wearing it! They get into a VIP booth, where the target is having fun with what looks like a prostitute. The crew is swift and put the target on the floor, while the girl they just met “pops off” his eyes.</li>
<li>The group successfully drive to a shady cybernetic clinic where Bennet has his new eyes implanted. They are ready to continue their mining contract now, and travel back to Perdurabo.</li>
<li>In the Cold Tomb, they find the Leadbelly docked to the tomb, while The Boxer’s ship - the Brutomaker - is docked to the second airlock of the Leadbelly. Oni docks the Frostbreaker to the Brutomaker.</li>
<li>MadSpark starts the first drone, but an issue with setting the explosives on the ice chunk means that drone is lost in space.</li>
<li>Olaf speaks with The Boxer over comms, and they agree to meet and trade a drone from the Brutomaker.</li>
<li>The Doomborg meets The Boxer and his crew, while they loot the Cold Tomb and move the valuables to the Brutomaker. The crew of the Leadbelly is tied up and gagged, and left in the Leadbelly for the Doomborgs to figure out.</li>
<li>Then, suddenly, while being playful with the new drone, MadSpark cause an accident and an oxygen leak in the Brutomaker. The two crews start running, but most of The Boxer’s crew was further in the aft of the starship, and are lost to space with everything in that part of the ship when it explodes.</li>
<li>Bennet and MadSpark are safe in the Frostbreaker, while Oni, Olaf and Sabaka - together with TheBoxer and his engineer and the hostages - are safe in the Leadbelly.</li>

<li>The Doomborgs receive a <strong>new contract</strong> that voids the exploration framework of the previous contract, but maintain taking down the directorship of <a href="../locations/BrightsideStation.md">BrightsideStation</a>
<ul>
<li>The crew will be paid C5k for each Hull cargo space full of unrefined mRNA-rich ice. This value is doubled if the ice is refined.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Doomborgs try to find a mobile extractor micro refinery to install on their ship, but that was too difficult in a planet like <a href="../locations/Defiance.md">Defiance</a>. Oni sends a message to her friend in <a href="../locations/TheSolomons.md">TheSolomons</a> and asks her to buy one and bring it to Brightside. The message ends with ‘<em>Don’t rip me off</em>’.</li>
<li>While trying to find an extractor, Danny inadvertently tells Harry Tungla that there was someone inside the box his trucker carried to the farm.</li>
<li>The crew then decides to take <a href="../npcs/CassianVireo.md">CassianVireo</a> with them to Brightside, for what she pays C2k.</li>
<li>Flying off defiance is delayed in 4 days, due to weather. But even when the weather improves the <a href="../objects/Frostbreaker.md">Frostbreaker</a> barely does it, with its fusion reactor shutting down due to load as the ship gains orbit.</li>
<li>They dock the ship in a refuelling station in high orbit and get a new drone, and from there depart to Perdurabo</li>

<li>Lomax asks the Doomborgs to be around when this happens, to show strength against <a href="../npcs/YashDutta.md">YashDutta</a>’s faction on the station.</li>
<li>Lomax also mentions that another <a href="../factions/tharsisMining.md">tharsisMining</a> ship (the Ore Voyager) recently refuelled in Brigthside, and the crew updates him that they also work for Tharsis. ‘<em>Why is Tharsis Mining involved in finding alien artefacts?</em>’.</li>

<li>Mining was a dangerous endeavour, where one drone and many ice cargoes were lost.</li>
<li>Incidentally, the crab infestation in the ship attacks Danny while he is piloting, in one of the most critical moments: Olaf and Oni are on an EVA, while Bennet is monitoring the harness.

<li>After this accident, the crew decides to go back to Brightside with a partial load. They would come back later with someone skilled in piloting the drones.</li>
<li>Upon arrival on Brightside, Danny is rushed into the infirmary. Olaf speaks with the doctor, <a href="../npcs/SuyinIndrani.md">SuyinIndrani</a>, who supports Dutta and thinks Lomax has poisoned the director. She also shares that Lomax is not liked by his own employees.</li>

<p><strong>Research the metallic egg and the alien language filmed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oni and Olaf are in the Frostbreaker, and start researching the alien bas relief from the cold tomb, recorded on film month ago.</li>
<li><strong>Metallic egg</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oni researches the egg. It is made of some unknown metal, with hardness 6.5 (slightly harder than a steel alloy)</li>
<li>The egg does not crush when hit repeatedly with a hammer, but no further destructive tests were conducted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCdfOrE.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Film</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bas relief is ritualistic in nature</li>
<li>On the right side, multiple species are shown to be linked somehow. This can be an evolutionary link, a carrier link, some kind of multi symbiosis or maybe some hive mind. They do remind Earth animals somehow.</li>
<li>On the left side, a technological insect humanoid species seems to control the other civilisation. They are clearly aliens to the beings on the right side.</li>
<li>It seems that the approach taken by the insectoids is to swarm a civilisation and conquer. They are shown with weapons.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Q6BYmV.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>As they look at the video, Olaf becomes very interested in the insectoid aliens and his mind is suddenly taken by the memories and emotions of his abduction decades ago. His mind rebuilds a perfect image of these aliens as Olaf starts to become anxious.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8D39rQN.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Half a second later a flash of light is seen from one of the windows of the Frosbreaker, Olaf curls himself in the floor, repeating some kind of mantra. Oni looks at the windows and sees that some kind of explosion has happened on the high deck of Brigthside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bombs in Brightside</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For those in Brigthside, a tremor is felt, and the alarm goes off first, then lights turn off, while emergency lights turn on.</li>
<li>Bennet and Danny come down from the infirmary carrying Sabaka, to meet Olaf and Oni again on the cargo bay.</li>
<li>The banker transport is preparing to depart, to avoid any kind of terrorist act that seems to be taking place in the station. As the belly of the ship is exposed, Olaf and Oni immediately notice some kind of explosive attached to the ship.</li>
<li>Olaf rapidly informs this on open channel to the banker transport and 20 seconds later a escape pod leaves the ship. A second escape pod leaves a minute later. The transport does not explode, yet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigate Dutta’s documents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Olaf speaks with <a href="../npcs/RolandLomax.md">RolandLomax</a> and take the documentations that would expose Dutta from Roland’s hands. Roland is ok with it, feeling it is the best route of action.</li>
<li>Oni quickly parse these documents and finds:
<ul>
<li>Embezzlement of <a href="../npcs/YashDutta.md">YashDutta</a>, who stole money during the construction of Brightside, alonside the son of one of the private minor investors.</li>
<li>Purchase orders from <strong>Recombination Group</strong> (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/1ouPtfu.png">logo</a>) for shipment of Novium - which might explain the fact the the station was not meeting Haruna’s production quotas.</li>
<li>MoU with <a href="../factions/makita.md">makita</a>’s subsidiary for ice mining rights - although the two companies are competitors and such an extraction agreement would not be allowed in the new space law from the <a href="../factions/ico.md">ico</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Repairs on the fusion reactor</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Haruna Banker</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../npcs/ElianaMurovec.md">ElianaMurovec</a> and her bodyguard leave the transport</li>

<li>Eliana agrees to a private conversation inside her pod where Olaf shares what he knows, and the documentation that proves it.</li>
<li>Eliana is flabbergast, and after thinking of her options, she offers to pay Olaf to take her back to <a href="../locations/TheSolomons.md">TheSolomons</a>.</li>

<li>Cassian explain she has been working in the Midnight Sun bar, and wishes to go back and leave Brightside, as she is afraid of what is happening.</li>
<li>Bennet promises to contact her again before they depart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decisions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The crew meets again in the cargo bay, and decide they will take the banker.</li>
<li>Before they leave, Bennet, Danny and Sabaka go to the Midnight Sun bar and speak with <a href="../npcs/MarionHardlee.md">MarionHardlee</a>. Marion confirms Cassian was never an employee on the bar. The crew decides to leave her behind, and it would be too risky to confront her now.</li>
<li>Bennet decides to inform the risk of Cassian to Roland, who becomes very unpleased. Roland demands that the Frosbreaker crew take Cassian back, if there is a risk she is the bomber. It was the Frostbreaker who brought Cassian to the station in the first place.</li>
<li>The conversation does not go well, and it turns to violence. Bennet quickly stab Roland twice before Roland decides to give up this fight. Roland covers his wound, and decide to go to the infirmary.</li>
<li>The crew discusses and decide it is best to leave Roland alive.</li>
<li>They board Eliana in the Frostbreaker and depart the station.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leaving Perdurabo, and…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Frostbreaker scoops hydrogen fuel from the penumbra of The Beast and are ready to go.</li>
<li>Around two days later, close to the edge of the Perdurabo system, something hard and heavy hits the Frostbreaker.</li>
<li>Alarms go off:
<ul>
<li>Mass centre of the ship has changed, something is attached to the Frostbreaker…</li>
<li>There is an attempt to breach the hull…</li>
<li>Nothing is seen, but the hull is cut open cold…</li>
<li>A flap of the hull is pulled to the outside, opening a hole…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The crew quickly move to the citadel of the ship once more. They take the metallic egg, inside a Faraday cage, with them. The rest of the ship looses pressure to space.</li>
<li>It will be an uncomfortable week travelling to <a href="../locations/Defiance.md">Defiance</a>, packed inside the citadel, with 2 additional people, and maybe <em>something</em> outside…</li>

<li>On the 6th day the fusion reactor in the ship stops working, due to the wear of the hot fix implemented before. The crew is too afraid to work it out now, and continue the spike drive on reserve power.</li>
<li>Upon arriving on the Teegarden’s Star system, they send an SOS to System Control, and all go outside the capela to repair the reactor.</li>
<li>In parallel, Olaf and Oni go pick up the metal egg from the escape pod and suddenly bump into an invisible volume. As this happens, the metal egg simply vanishes in thin air.</li>
<li>With the reactor repaired, Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. The manager does not seem interested in helping the crew, and sees an opportunity for them dying and Tharsis Mining not having to pay for the complete mission.</li>
<li>He does commend the crew on their tactics of bringing a terrorist to Perdurabo.</li>
<li>After landing in Defiance, Olaf reports the alien to the ICO, and Eliana pays the crew for her transport.</li>
<li>The crew is now driven to take down John McLeod. But first, a visit to the low life bar close to the repair docks.</li>
</ul>
