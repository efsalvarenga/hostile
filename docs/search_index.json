An ice sample was bought by Tharsis‚Äô Parkfield Biolabs, which contained RNA that can be used to cure early dementia caused by frequent faster than light travel. The RNA named Neuroplasticity Augmentor Sequence (NAS-RNA), however, the RNA cannot be easily replicated in laboratory. For this reason, the discovery was not made public yet, and Tharsis has been moving fast to evaluate the feasibility to establish an ice mine in the system. If proven feasible, the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system is an advantage. The station is a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play (see Hostile-Setting 82, for detail on the licensing process). Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station‚Äôs steel skin. Contract Contract signed with Tharsis Mining General Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod. You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. Non-disclosed milestones, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of Brightside station, so its later acquisition is even cheaper. Contracted roles and milestones are detailed below. Monthly salary is Salary + Multiplier x Profession Rank. Each milestone pays a bonus of a number of times the crew monthly salary. The crew will have a LTDA company where they are the shareholders. Basic ship maintenance &amp; fuel is paid by shipowner, additional repairs &amp; fuels are paid by the LTDA (discounted for contract payment). Ship must dock for life support supplies every 6 weeks (max life support is 2 months). Work shifts are 12x12, 7 days a week. You will carry a holographic AI suitcase to speak with the GM weekly on Saturdays. Replacements (in case of sickness or indisposition) will be sent from the fastest system where they can be available.

It is understood that the crew of the starship shall adhere to all safety protocols, follow mining regulations, and report any unusual discoveries or incidents to the Consortium immediately. This certificate is subject to revocation in the event of safety violations or any activities deemed harmful to the Consortium&#39;s interests. Safe travels and may your ice mining endeavors yield bountiful resources. Authorized by: Director Seraphina Thornblade Director of the Mining Regulatory Agency Date: September 20, 2225 Perdurabo The Doomborgs On the evening before the mission kick-off meeting with Tharsis Mining Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod, the crew find a scientist from Haruna tied to a bomb in the toilets of a bar in French Guiana. They learn of the animosity of the Lebkuchen activists against Haruna‚Äôs cloning endeavours. After all that is sorted, they decide to bet on Olaf in a boxing ring, which proves to be successful. On the next day they finally meet with John McLeod, and preparations for the travel to Perdurabo start. 1.1 The Frostbreaker The Doomborgs crew arrives in Brightside. Brightside is a space mining station owned by Haruna, part of the Matsuyama group. The crew meets a few of the faces on the station and take a space raft to their own ship, which is stationary close by Brightside. After a quick inspection, the Frostbreaker seems in order, and the crew get back to Brightside to sign paperwork. While mingling a bit more with the inhabitants of the station, they end up befriending Marius, a scientific representative from Makita (part of the Wu-Ketai group). He is invited for a mission launch party onboard the Frostbreaker and, on the way there, the crew also invites Roland. Everyone gets drunk and drugged and some information is learned: Marius thinks his job is demeaning while Roland has data that incriminates Yash (Brightside Director) of embezzlement. In the following morning the crew have a virtual meeting with John McLeod, who is unhappy that some information might have leaked about the intention to drill ice in the asteroid. Olaf takes a decision to visit one of the sky tombs in the region, to pretend the crew is one of adventurers and dismiss questions. The crew goes back and negotiate with Marius and Ranse, and they purchase the coordinates of one of the sky tombs that could possess some riches. MadSpark‚Äôs version of the story &gt; MadSpark doesn‚Äôt remember much of this, his version of events goes as follows &gt; - arrived at a space station after a boring travel but made a neat little BB Gun from my seatbelt &gt; - got told to put my shotgun in a locker (but luckily kept my hunting knife) &gt; - found some great spare parts for the little drone I‚Äôve been planning to make &gt; - the ship has a basic but adequately equipped workshop, so started work on the drone &gt; - everyone wanted to explore the space station &amp; I needed a drink anyway so off we went &gt; - then there were some of these guys who had a bug in their asses about something to do with stealing (apparently it‚Äôs not allowed here‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) but the skipper sorted it out &amp; then we headed to the bar (it‚Äôs interesting that the cameras here are ATX18956 model - I haven‚Äôt seen those of years, I‚Äôll have to take one apart at some point for nostalgic reasons) &gt; - I bought drinks all night &amp; did that trick with the exploding gunpowder shots - I don‚Äôt remember much after that &gt; - Oh yeah, we‚Äôre going to see if we can find some valuable alien artefacts to make some extra moolah üí∞(sounds more interesting than the mission anyway!) 1.2 The old tomb The Doomborgs crew arrive in the Cold Tomb. The structure was built in an ice chunk in one of the asteroids in the Perdurabo system. The ship is docked in the entrance of the tomb, and Olaf and Oliver suit up and are ready in the air lock. Through a scan they know that beyond the tomb entrance door the environment is filled with icy water. The two crewmen venture inside, with a system of communication and power umbilicals and a 50 meter harness cable. Sabaka stays behind in the airlock ready to rewind the cable if necessary. In the entrance room, shaped like a sphere, they record on their cameras alien language carved in the icy wall, and an image depicting a blurred humanoid alien in what seems like a position of power. While this was happening, MadSpark feels the need of action, and leaves the ship in a second airlock. While investigating the surroundings of the construction, he detects faint biological matter readings on his suit. He communicates that to Olaf and Oliver, who now turn on their precise detectors too, receiving the same readings. The crew hypothesise that the readings are coming from the water (melted from the asteroid ice), and take a sample from inside the tomb. MadSpark gets back on the ship and take the sample to the lab. He starts to feel dizzy. In the tomb, Oliver and Olaf reach another room where they find dozens of alien bodies floating in the water. They quickly grab one and, in a haste movement, decide to retreat to the spaceship. On their way back, a drone swims in their direction and shoots a shard of metal in their direction, but the crewmen were faster and lock themselves in the airlock before the drone can enter. Oni skillfully undock the Frostbreaker from the tomb and pilot the ship back to Brightside. After decontaminating the air, Olaf and Oliver join the crew in the ship again, but now everyone is feeling slightly sick, unfocused and dizzy. On the way back, some movement readings withing the starship structure alert Oni. The crew quickly retreat to the citadel and command the ship from there. They soon see in the cameras a dozens crab-like alien creatures exploring she starship. MadSpark flushes the starship atmosphere. At the same time Olaf starts to feel very sick and anxious. He thinks for a brief moment that MadSpark is flushing the citadel and panics. The other crew members calm him down, and they all see the crab creatures passing out. Upon arrival in Brightside, Yash Dutta does not allow the immediate off boarding of the crew due to contamination risk, and Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. John quickly decides that the finding is too high profile, and the Doomborgs are ordered to immediatelly travel back to Earth. After a failed attempt to threat Yash, the Frostbreaker departs from Brightside. The destination is the Teegarden‚Äôs Star system, where in the main world (Defiance) a remote office of Tharsis and the ICO (Interstellar Commerce Organisation) are available. 1.3 Defiance and back The Doomborgs crew travel to the neighbour system: the Teegarden‚Äôs Star. During the spike drill, Bennet used the time to execute a biopsy on one of the crab creatures that infested the starship previously. The doctor was very unlucky when a splash of acid hits his eyes, blinding him. Upon arriving on Teegarden‚Äôs Star, the captain makes contact with the system control and gets redirected to the Tharsis Mining office on the Defiance. A shuttle picks the crew from orbit and a truck and a car takes them and the corpse to the corporation estate. The Doomborgs meet Lucas, a rough operations coordinator in the system, who explains next steps: they are to complete the mining contract as fast as possible, avoiding any further information leak. The Boxer crew, a group of mercenaries, will be responsible for collecting the remaining corpses and taking them to Earth. While the meeting goes on, Bennet is in the hospital, and learns his eyes are doomed. He will need a cybernetic implant, and that can be arranged within a week. The crew meets again, and decide that waiting a week would be too long. Sabaka connects on the dark web and finds a fixer that can help them get a second hand cybereyes set within a day. The Doomborgs agree with the fixer and go to the appointed location, a district nightclub. In the nightclub they meet an energetic girl, who are to guide them getting the second hand cybereyes - from someone wearing it! They get into a VIP booth, where the target is having fun with what looks like a prostitute. The crew is swift and put the target on the floor, while the girl they just met ‚Äúpops off‚Äù his eyes. The group successfully drive to a shady cybernetic clinic where Bennet has his new eyes implanted. They are ready to continue their mining contract now, and travel back to Perdurabo. In the Cold Tomb, they find the Leadbelly docked to the tomb, while The Boxer‚Äôs ship - the Brutomaker - is docked to the second airlock of the Leadbelly. Oni docks the Frostbreaker to the Brutomaker. MadSpark starts the first drone, but an issue with setting the explosives on the ice chunk means that drone is lost in space. Olaf speaks with The Boxer over comms, and they agree to meet and trade a drone from the Brutomaker. The Doomborg meets The Boxer and his crew, while they loot the Cold Tomb and move the valuables to the Brutomaker. The crew of the Leadbelly is tied up and gagged, and left in the Leadbelly for the Doomborgs to figure out. Then, suddenly, while being playful with the new drone, MadSpark cause an accident and an oxygen leak in the Brutomaker. The two crews start running, but most of The Boxer‚Äôs crew was further in the aft of the starship, and are lost to space with everything in that part of the ship when it explodes. Bennet and MadSpark are safe in the Frostbreaker, while Oni, Olaf and Sabaka - together with TheBoxer and his engineer and the hostages - are safe in the Leadbelly. 1.4 MadSpark perishes TheBoxer is pissed off but also afraid: Were them send by the ico? Are they here to kill us?! Who sent you? Who fucking sent you??!! TheBoxer mentions he will kill MadSpark, but Olaf asks him not to take any actions The Doomborgs count their numbers, after the explosion of the Brutomaker. It seems Sabaka is missing in action. Most of TheBoxer ‚Äôs crew has also perished. There is a high stakes discussion between TheBoxer and Olaf, where the boxer agrees to stay in the Leadbelly while the Doomborgs discuss. Oni communicates with Oliver Bennet and MadSpark who are on the Frostbreaker, and agree on a debris-free area to dock both ships. MadSpark does a fearsome flyby with the Frostbreaker, scaring Oliver Bennet. Olaf and Oni try to convince MadSpark to retire from the crew, after the unfortunate actions of MadSpark. They propose tying up the engineer to guarantee everyone‚Äôs safety. Madspark does not agree, and runs and locks himself in the workshop. Olaf, afraid of what could happen in the workshop makes a tough decision and commands all crew to go to the bridge, while he flushes the air from the ship. MadSpark perishes trying to escape though a ventilation shaft. Oliver questions the leadership of Olaf: ‚ÄúSir, I don‚Äôt think you are leading us for the successful completion of our contract. Now we don‚Äôt have all required skills in the crew. We need those skills - I could‚Äôt care less for the human lives lost.‚Äù |400 Considering his remaining options, TheBoxer sees an opportunity to forge his own death and finally retire in a small farm in Defiance. This setup is agreed with everyone, but it requires erasing the proofs of Boxer being alive - which includes killing the hostages from the Leadbelly. The Boxer and Oliver coldly push RanseHardlee, RandallBellows, JaffaOkoye from the airlock. The Boxer parks the Leadbelly in a hidden coordinate in the asteroid field. The crew takes the Frostbreaker to BrightsideStation. An afraid YashDutta greets them, and allow them to refuel, but not to enter the station. Oni skilfully uninstall the lead panels from theFrostbreaker, so they can land the ship in Defiance to drop the Boxer. 1.5 The Boxer‚Äôs box The Doomborgs took their time and evaluated all the options to unload TheBoxer into Defiance. They decide that putting The Boxer in a large box is the best alternative. They called flight control from Defiance and requested to speak with tharsisMining. Lucas called back and agreed to find a maintenance bay for the Frostbreaker in two days. Oni skilfully (again) landed the Frostbreaker through a light storm for Defiance‚Äôs standards. |400 Lucas spoke again with the crew, and was astonished to know that JohnMcLeod speaks with the crew through an AI version of himself - this is not allowed on Earth. Lucas also updates the crew that information leaked about the alien bodies, and the possible extraction of the mRNA - which is expensive in the market. Olaf becomes anxious, and postpone the next chat with JohnMcLeod Danny and Oliver go to a local lowlife bar and meet the owner of a small and shady logistics company, Harry. Harry agrees to take the box and ask no questions. |400 The crew meet again at the bay, prepare everything and load the box with The Boxer into Harry‚Äôs company truckers‚Äô truck. The crew speaks with JohnMcLeod who confirms what Lucas has shared. John mentions that there is an inevitable gold rush about to start for Perdurabo. The crew is to be back there ASAP, and start mining as much as possible. A new contract will be sent to them. After the long day, Oliver goes take a nap, while the others decide to continue drinking into the small hours. In the same low life bar the crew meet a (very drunk) CassianVireo Cassian mentions she is an investigator, and she wants to get information on what is happening in BrightsideStation and the Perdurabo system. Cassian offers her skills in computing and communications in return to be brought to Brightside. The crew is undecided and were to speak with her again next day, before departing Defiance. |400 1.6 Start of Dutta‚Äôs fall The Doomborgs receive a new contract that voids the exploration framework of the previous contract, but maintain taking down the directorship of BrightsideStation The crew will be paid C5k for each Hull cargo space full of unrefined mRNA-rich ice. This value is doubled if the ice is refined. The Doomborgs try to find a mobile extractor micro refinery to install on their ship, but that was too difficult in a planet like Defiance. Oni sends a message to her friend in TheSolomons and asks her to buy one and bring it to Brightside. The message ends with ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt rip me off‚Äô. While trying to find an extractor, Danny inadvertently tells Harry Tungla that there was someone inside the box his trucker carried to the farm. The crew then decides to take CassianVireo with them to Brightside, for what she pays C2k. Flying off defiance is delayed in 4 days, due to weather. But even when the weather improves the Frostbreaker barely does it, with its fusion reactor shutting down due to load as the ship gains orbit. They dock the ship in a refuelling station in high orbit and get a new drone, and from there depart to Perdurabo Upon arriving in Brightside, the Doomborgs learn that Dutta has fallen ill, and RolandLomax is now in charge. It became useful that the crew had a night drinking with Lomax when they first arrived in Perdurabo. Lomax asks them to offboard the Frostbreaker and explains that in about 6 days a large haruna bank transport will arrive to carry the Novium ingots. A bank auditor will be on this ship, and Lomax intends to share the information he has about Dutta‚Äôs embezzlement. Lomax asks the Doomborgs to be around when this happens, to show strength against YashDutta‚Äôs faction on the station. Lomax also mentions that another tharsisMining ship (the Ore Voyager) recently refuelled in Brigthside, and the crew updates him that they also work for Tharsis. ‚ÄòWhy is Tharsis Mining involved in finding alien artefacts?‚Äô. |400 The crew goes back to the ColdTomb to mine the mRNA-rich ice around the construction (that is now destroyed). Mining was a dangerous endeavour, where one drone and many ice cargoes were lost. Incidentally, the crab infestation in the ship attacks Danny while he is piloting, in one of the most critical moments: Olaf and Oni are on an EVA, while Bennet is monitoring the harness. Danny is alone in the bridge and tries to fight off the crabs. He was unsuccessful and falls with a mortal face wound when one of the crabs lands on his face. The other crew members rush back when they notice Danny screaming, and Olaf in a heroic save fends off multiple crabs while grappling an unconscious Danny. The Doomborgs are able to seal the crabs in the bridge and Bennet with his laser sharp medic skills is able to stabilise Danny - who looked dead already. After this accident, the crew decides to go back to Brightside with a partial load. They would come back later with someone skilled in piloting the drones. Upon arrival on Brightside, Danny is rushed into the infirmary. Olaf speaks with the doctor, SuyinIndrani, who supports Dutta and thinks Lomax has poisoned the director. She also shares that Lomax is not liked by his own employees. The personnel on the station start to go about quickly now, as the bank‚Äôs transport is arriving. Lomax is ready to share what he knows. 1.7 Chaos in Brightside Arrival of Sabaka The banker transport arrives and, while they wait and prepare to disembark, a burnt escape pod also arrives in the station. Inside the pod is Sabaka, unconscious. There is also a significant amount of transparent and reflective goo. A technician takes the goo to the station laboratory for study. Sakaba is taken to the infirmary, where they are evaluated. Oliver Bennet helps Dr SuyinIndrani and finds a metallic object inside Sabaka‚Äôs anus. Sabaka wakes up as the object is being removed. Olaf and Oni go to the Frostbreaker to study the egg like metallic object. Bennet stays in the infirmary with Sabaka and Danny, who were recovering from the PopperSwarm attack. Research the metallic egg and the alien language filmed. Oni and Olaf are in the Frostbreaker, and start researching the alien bas relief from the cold tomb, recorded on film month ago. Metallic egg Oni researches the egg. It is made of some unknown metal, with hardness 6.5 (slightly harder than a steel alloy) The egg does not crush when hit repeatedly with a hammer, but no further destructive tests were conducted. Film Bas relief is ritualistic in nature On the right side, multiple species are shown to be linked somehow. This can be an evolutionary link, a carrier link, some kind of multi symbiosis or maybe some hive mind. They do remind Earth animals somehow. On the left side, a technological insect humanoid species seems to control the other civilisation. They are clearly aliens to the beings on the right side. It seems that the approach taken by the insectoids is to swarm a civilisation and conquer. They are shown with weapons. As they look at the video, Olaf becomes very interested in the insectoid aliens and his mind is suddenly taken by the memories and emotions of his abduction decades ago. His mind rebuilds a perfect image of these aliens as Olaf starts to become anxious. Half a second later a flash of light is seen from one of the windows of the Frosbreaker, Olaf curls himself in the floor, repeating some kind of mantra. Oni looks at the windows and sees that some kind of explosion has happened on the high deck of Brigthside. Bombs in Brightside For those in Brigthside, a tremor is felt, and the alarm goes off first, then lights turn off, while emergency lights turn on. Bennet and Danny come down from the infirmary carrying Sabaka, to meet Olaf and Oni again on the cargo bay. The banker transport is preparing to depart, to avoid any kind of terrorist act that seems to be taking place in the station. As the belly of the ship is exposed, Olaf and Oni immediately notice some kind of explosive attached to the ship. Olaf rapidly informs this on open channel to the banker transport and 20 seconds later a escape pod leaves the ship. A second escape pod leaves a minute later. The transport does not explode, yet. Investigate Dutta‚Äôs documents Olaf speaks with RolandLomax and take the documentations that would expose Dutta from Roland‚Äôs hands. Roland is ok with it, feeling it is the best route of action. Oni quickly parse these documents and finds: Embezzlement of YashDutta, who stole money during the construction of Brightside, alonside the son of one of the private minor investors. Purchase orders from Recombination Group (logo) for shipment of Novium - which might explain the fact the the station was not meeting Haruna‚Äôs production quotas. MoU with makita‚Äôs subsidiary for ice mining rights - although the two companies are competitors and such an extraction agreement would not be allowed in the new space law from the ico. Repairs on the fusion reactor Oni and Bennet go to the high deck to help repair the fusion reactor. The core is not damaged, but most auxiliary systems are destroyed. It will take weeks, if not months, for a complete fix. A crew of technicians start the work. The Haruna Banker ElianaMurovec and her bodyguard leave the transport Olaf softly tells her of the documents the crew has in their possession. Eliana agrees to a private conversation inside her pod where Olaf shares what he knows, and the documentation that proves it. Eliana is flabbergast, and after thinking of her options, she offers to pay Olaf to take her back to TheSolomons. Olaf explains he needs to discuss it with his crew first, and leaves the pod. Conversation with CassianVireo Bennet finds Cassian again, in the midst of turmoil in the station. Cassian explain she has been working in the Midnight Sun bar, and wishes to go back and leave Brightside, as she is afraid of what is happening. Bennet promises to contact her again before they depart. Decisions The crew meets again in the cargo bay, and decide they will take the banker. Before they leave, Bennet, Danny and Sabaka go to the Midnight Sun bar and speak with MarionHardlee. Marion confirms Cassian was never an employee on the bar. The crew decides to leave her behind, and it would be too risky to confront her now. Bennet decides to inform the risk of Cassian to Roland, who becomes very unpleased. Roland demands that the Frosbreaker crew take Cassian back, if there is a risk she is the bomber. It was the Frostbreaker who brought Cassian to the station in the first place. The conversation does not go well, and it turns to violence. Bennet quickly stab Roland twice before Roland decides to give up this fight. Roland covers his wound, and decide to go to the infirmary. The crew discusses and decide it is best to leave Roland alive. They board Eliana in the Frostbreaker and depart the station. Leaving Perdurabo, and‚Ä¶ The Frostbreaker scoops hydrogen fuel from the penumbra of The Beast and are ready to go. Around two days later, close to the edge of the Perdurabo system, something hard and heavy hits the Frostbreaker. Alarms go off: Mass centre of the ship has changed, something is attached to the Frostbreaker‚Ä¶ There is an attempt to breach the hull‚Ä¶ Nothing is seen, but the hull is cut open cold‚Ä¶ A flap of the hull is pulled to the outside, opening a hole‚Ä¶ The crew quickly move to the citadel of the ship once more. They take the metallic egg, inside a Faraday cage, with them. The rest of the ship looses pressure to space. It will be an uncomfortable week travelling to Defiance, packed inside the citadel, with 2 additional people, and maybe something outside‚Ä¶ 1.8 Hitchhiker log transmission [====================] OK date: 2226.01.01 - 2226.01.10 sector: NEZ Near Earth Zone system: Perdurabo system: Teegarden&#39;s Star world: Defiance location: Tharsis Maintenance Docks vehicle: ECS Starbounder Frostbreaker GSV-112578 log disconnection OK The Doomborgs start investigating what could be inside the Frostbreaker. It seems like an invisible alien. Oni quickly checks all possible sensors and decide to go with a thermal sensor to detect friction. It seems that an alien creature is touching all aspects of the starship. The group checks their options and decide to turn on the sprinklers, to get a better view of the topology of the alien. The crew thinks about their options and decide to set up a trap, moving the metal egg to one of the escape pods. Olaf and Bennet execute the plan. Unfortunately the Metaliano does not fall into the trap. Further, Oni locks the alien in one of the rooms, but it seems to be able to cut open metal as if it is butter - with come kind of tool that vanishes after being used. Oni and Danny investigate the risks of spike driving with the cut in the ship hull, but Oni deems the eletromagnetic field can be used to protect the ship from meta dimensional energies. The Frostbreaker spike drives towards Teegarden‚Äôs Star. The alien spends all days systematically searching through the starship, touching everything and moving in an seemingly erratic, but systematic and fast, pace. Like an insect. On the 6th day the fusion reactor in the ship stops working, due to the wear of the hot fix implemented before. The crew is too afraid to work it out now, and continue the spike drive on reserve power. Upon arriving on the Teegarden‚Äôs Star system, they send an SOS to System Control, and all go outside the capela to repair the reactor. In parallel, Olaf and Oni go pick up the metal egg from the escape pod and suddenly bump into an invisible volume. As this happens, the metal egg simply vanishes in thin air. With the reactor repaired, Olaf decides to speak with John McLeod. The manager does not seem interested in helping the crew, and sees an opportunity for them dying and Tharsis Mining not having to pay for the complete mission. He does commend the crew on their tactics of bringing a terrorist to Perdurabo. After landing in Defiance, Olaf reports the alien to the ICO, and Eliana pays the crew for her transport. The crew is now driven to take down John McLeod. But first, a visit to the low life bar close to the repair docks.

He is an old (but athletic) failed geologist who became a geography teacher for teenagers. He spends most of his time looking for proofs that intelligent aliens exist and they are good to us. He is sure they are the ones responsible for establishing the mega corporations and we have only to thank them for improving our world. As a kid he was (or thinks he was) abducted by Greys. And that they implanted something on him that healed him from asthma. He believes the aliens spared him for a reason. And that reason is to help the mega corporations thrive. For decades he religiously went to the gym and trained boxing. He used to be wiser, though.
