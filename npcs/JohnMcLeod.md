> [!danger] Manneirism and visual aspects
> - This is the heart of the template, but it should also be the shortest section. The NPC generator contains entries for both.
> - Two or three brief bullet points at most. You’re looking to identify the essential elements which will “unlock” the character for you. There are no firm rules here, but I will always try to include at least one simple, physical action that you can perform while playing the character at the table. For example, maybe they tap their ear. Or are constantly wearing a creepy smile. Or they arch their eyebrow. Or they speak with a particular accent or affectation. Or they clap their hands and rub them together. Or snap their fingers and point at the person they’re talking to. Or make a point of taking a slow sip from their drink before responding to questions.
> - You don’t have to make a big deal of it and it usually won’t be something that you do constantly (that gets annoying), but this mannerism is your hook: You’ll find that you can quickly get back into the character by simply performing the mannerism. It will make your players remember the NPC as a distinct individual. And it can even make playing scenes with multiple NPCs easier to run (because you can use the mannerisms to clearly distinguish the characters you’re swapping between).
> - You’ll generally only need one mannerism. Maybe two. More than that and you lose the simple utility of the mannerism in unnecessary complexity. It’s not that the character’s entire personality is this one thing; it’s that the rest of the character’s personality will flow out of you whenever you hit that touchstone.
> - One visual aspect, such as a mutation.

> [!example] Personality traits and attitude
> Some summary 2 sentences based on their tags (except if it is background related), and some or all of the below:
> - Ambitions, powers, dreads
> - Strength
> - Virtue
> - Flaw
> - Problem
> - Desire

> [!info] Background
>  This section is narrative in nature. You can let it breathe a bit more than the other sections if you’d like, but a little will still go a long way. I tend to think of this in terms of essential context and interesting anecdotes. Is it something that will directly influence the decisions they make? Is it information that the PCs are likely to discover about them? Is it an interesting story that the NPC might tell about themselves or (better yet) use as context for explaining something? Great. If it’s just a short story about some random person’s life that you’re writing for an audience of one, refocus your attention on prepping material that’s relevant to the players.

> [!success] Key info and notes
> - In bullet point format, lay out the essential interaction or information that the PCs are supposed to get from the NPC.
> - The nature of this section will vary depending on the scenario and the NPC’s role in it, but the most obvious example is a mystery scenario in which the NPC has a clue.
> - Rather than burying that clue in the narrative of the NPC’s background, you’re yanking it and placing it in a list to make sure you don’t lose track of it during play. 
> - You could also use this section to lay out the terms of employment being offered by the Mysterious Man in the Tavern.
> - Or to list the discounts offered by a shopkeeper.
> - It’s a flexible tool.
> - In some cases, it might get quite long. But try to keep it well-organized (using the bullet points will help with that). If it just becomes a giant wall of text, its purpose has been lost.
