# Overview
***Faction turns on days `01` and `21` on `odd` months, and `11` on `even` months***

The faction / corporation presence below is only relevant on the American sector of NEZ. For other regions of space (or Earth) a new table must be made.

```dataview
table without ID link(file.link, name) AS "Faction", meta.die as "Die"
from "hostile/factions"
WHERE contains(meta.category, "faction")=true
sort id asc
```

# Next turn on 2225-11-21

Try faction system with one roll dice pool on small tray. Run by writing. Use tarot for ideas if necessary (until I find random tables - GB has some?)

***Chain reaction from Tharsis to Haruna, then to Makita, then to ICO.***
- Haruna figured out that the Doomborgs are working for Tharsis.
- In the process, Makita is also made aware because of the scientist in Perdurabo (information leaks)
- The ICO traces the presence of the Doomborgs in Teegarden Star, and now are interested in the Doomborgs as well.
