One of the most powerful agencies across human-explored space is the Interstellar Commerce Organization (ICO), a body created by the United Corporate Combine to regulate space commerce, space travel and interstellar trade. It is headquartered in Singapore, on Earth, and has been responsible over the past fifty years for establishing fuel prices, standards of measurement, communication protocols, starport layouts and much more. It serves the interstellar corporate community and its inspectors are constantly on the prowl, investigating accidents and checking licenses. The ICO publishes many of the standard handbooks for spaceflight that all starships are, by law, obliged to carry onboard. There is an ICO office at every A, B and C class starport.
