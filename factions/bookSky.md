# Book of the Sky Solomons

*Even today, no one is entirely certain how he managed it. A prototype spike drive would have required six days of metadimensional travel to reach Alpha Centauri and drill down into mundane space. Crohn claimed to be alone aboard the ship, but such would have required him to remain awake and navigating the uncharted drill course for six straight days, all without any hint of prior experience. The creed that later became known as the Book of the Sky refers to it as “the Night Journey of the Prophet Tiberius” and considers it the founding event of the faith.*
