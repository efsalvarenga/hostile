Just before the spike drills.

**Arrival in Teegarden System.**
- Tharsis will organise a shuttle to take the corpse to a large transport to Earth (in secret)
- ICO would want to have the corpse too, and can promise protection.
- Only factions aware of the corpse would (now) chase the PCs

> [!example] Situations 

Research on the alien language

Travel back to Perdurabo with the crew of The Boxer (coming from The Solomons - they will take 3+6 days to get there) meeting you there, to gather as many corpses as possible and then deliver the contract working 48h per day. Need to map the ice and conclude the work **urgently** and **stealthly**.
