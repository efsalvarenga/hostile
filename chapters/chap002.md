Going to the Cold Tombs
- The Tomb is a dangerous one, but probably full of riches. The dislike [RanseHardlee](../npcs/RanseHardlee.md) has with [Olaf](../pcs/Olaf.md) influenced him to make a choice to share the coordinates of this Tomb. [MariusRochambeau](../npcs/MariusRochambeau.md) is also very keen on the riches. The two of them will share some of the profit from the findings.
